## Here is the task:



* [x] use the API https://swapi.dev  to fetch data using php  (no frontend technology like TypeScript, JavaScript, JQuery,...)

* [ ] display a list/table of 15 starships (name, model, cargo capacity) ordered by fastest (descending).

  * [x] if possible list their pilots as well (name, height) to know the crew better.

  * [x] else it would be nice to know the crew size.

  * [ ] each ship in list should show how much slower it is in percent regarding to the fastest one.

* [x] build the ships as own class in PHP

  * [x] the ships should be able to transport different objects as some cargo  which can get added by using a method (cargo reduces cargo capacity).

  * [x] the attributes of the ships should be accessible by getters/setters



* [ ] to display the results, you can decide to use html or commandline output.
  * Because of time I just made it a simple json API with one single endpoint 
    * `http:\\localhost\api\starships`

* [x] you can handover the code using a public github repo, bitbucket repo, â€¦  your choice ðŸ˜‰
